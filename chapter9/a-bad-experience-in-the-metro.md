# A bad experience in the metro

What I have written:

> The temperature is a little lower than yesterday. And it is raining. fortunately there's no wind. So it feels a little colder than yesterday. People just wear a little more clothes.
>
>
>
> But inside the metro. It is much hotter than the outside. So people may feel even hotter because they wear more clothes than yesterday. And what makes it worse is that the metro system even stop the air conditioner. So you will feel much much hotter inside the metro station. Including in the train. With no fresh air and no air conditioning, when you walk a litter fast, you will even sweat.

> This is quite embarrassing. People tend to wear more when the weather become colder. But because the temperature goes down, the metro also stops the air conditioner, you will feel much hotter inside the metro station. So you have to get off one cloth when you enter the metro station. And you have to put it on when you exit the metro station.

> This is quite uncomfortable to commuters, I think all those smart people should figure out some way to solve this problem.

> Revised Version:&#x20;
>
> The temperature is slightly lower than yesterday with the rain, and fortunately there's no wind. However, the damp cold feels more biting, so people are naturally wearing extra layers.
>
>
>
> But here's the irony - stepping into the metro feels like entering a sauna compared to the chilly outdoors. To make matters worse, the metro system has turned off the air conditioning entirely. Now commuters are trapped between the cold outside and stifling heat underground. The faster you walk through the stations, the more you sweat in your winter gear.

> This creates an awkward cycle: people add layers for the cold weather â†’ metro disables AC due to cooler temperatures â†’ passengers overheat underground â†’ constantly dressing/undressing during their commute. It's incredibly inconvenient, especially during rush hours. Surely our smart city planners could devise a better climate control solution for subway systems!

> Key Improvements:
>
> 1. Logical Flow
>    1. Added transitional words (However, But here's the irony, To make matters worse) to better connect ideas.
> 2. Verb Precision
>    1. â€¢"walk a little fast" â†’ "the faster you walk"
>    2. â€¢"get off one cloth" â†’ "constantly dressing/undressing"
> 3. Tense Consistency
>    1. Changed mixed tenses to present tense for consistency ("has turned off" instead of "stop")
> 4. Clearer Cause-Effect
>    1. Used arrows (â†’) to visually demonstrate the compounding problem
> 5.  Stronger Conclusion
>
>     1. Ended with a rhetorical challenge to authorities for better solutions&#x20;

> Practice Suggestions:
>
> 1. Try rewriting this using the "You'd think..., but nope!" structure from our previous practice:"You'd think the metro would balance temperatures better, but nope! We're roasting like chestnuts down here!"
> 2. Experiment with sensory verbs: Instead of "feel hotter" â†’ "sweat through your scarf" / "fog up the windows with your breath" Would you like me to help you practice specific sentence structures or vocabulary related to this topic? ðŸ˜Š
